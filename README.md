# Replication package for "Combinatorial Transition Testing in Dynamically Adaptive Systems" submitted to JSS2024.

This replication package aims at reproducing results for the Section 7 of "CCombinatorial Transition Testing in Dynamically Adaptive Systems: Implementation and Test Oracle" by Pierre Martou, Beno√Æt Duhoux, Kim Mens and Axel Legay, at JSS2024.

## Requirements
The code requires standard python3 to execute correctly. It also requires the following packages:

- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- python-sat

This list is also in "requirements.txt" in order to install these packages easily by using "pip install -r requirements.txt" (only on Linux machines).

## Usage

You simply need to launch main.py with no parameters (i.e. "python3 main"). All parameters are explained and chosen at runtime.
